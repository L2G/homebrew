brew:
  bad_sudo: "Cowardly refusing to `sudo brew %1`"
  bad_xcode_path: |
    Your xcode-select path is currently set to '/'.
    This causes the `xcrun` tool to hang, and can render Homebrew unusable.
    If you are using Xcode, you should:
      sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app
    Otherwise, you should:
      sudo rm -rf /usr/share/xcode-select
  formula_unspecified: "This command requires a formula argument"
  homebrew_version: "Homebrew %1"
  invalid_usage: "Invalid usage"
  keg_unspecified: "This command requires a keg argument"
  no_tiger_support: |
    homebrew requires leopard or higher. for tiger support, see:
    https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew
  no_working_dir: "The current working directory doesn't exist, cannot proceed."
  please_report_bug: "Please report this bug:"
  refuse_root_or_usr: "Cowardly refusing to continue at this prefix: %1"
  unknown_command: "Unknown command: %1"

cmd:

  # `help` command
  #
  # NOTE Keep the lenth of vanilla --help less than 25 lines!
  # This is because the default Terminal height is 25 lines. Scrolling sucks
  # and concision is important. If more help is needed we should start
  # specialising help like the gem command does.
  # NOTE Keep lines less than 80 characters! Wrapping is just not cricket.
